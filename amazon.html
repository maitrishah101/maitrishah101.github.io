					At <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" style="color: #1DADA8; text-decoration: underline"> Amazon </a>, I was
					on the AWS Managed Services (AMS) Platform Team. AMS is an organization within Amazon Web Services (AWS) at Amazon.
					AMS supports and maintains the infrastrucutre that customer apps are built upon, and AMS takes responsibility for
					operating all AWS services end to end for customers.

					<br></br>

					My intern project during Summer 2019 was to find drift in stacks between CloudFormation and an internal tool called SKMS (Service Knowledge Management System) that the
					AMS Platform team owns. SKMS manages knowledge for AMS, and keeps track of stack, subnet, and VPC information
					for customers. SKMS has to be used to create/delete stacks in CloudFormation but sometimes it is bypassed and this causes drift.

					<br></br>

					I learned a lot about AWS and Java throughout my internship and it was amazing being in Seattle as well. If you want to learn more about
					my internship and what it was like working at Amazon, feel free to check out
