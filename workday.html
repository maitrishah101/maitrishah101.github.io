				<p>

					At <a href="https://www.workday.com/" style="color: #EABFB9; text-decoration: underline"> Workday </a>, I was on the Big Data Services Team. My job was to develop Python scripts to recover and purge
					versions of data that the client specified (think of it as version control for clients of Workday).

					<br></br>

					My project provides a safety net for clients in the chance that they want to revert back to previous versions.
					I learned new technical skills, including how to work with Boto3 and AWS. I also learned soft skills, like how to
					communicate my ideas and work together in a team. I also learned the importance of company culture and that it's
					okay to ask for help.

					<br></br>

					Throughout my internship, I got to participate in really fun intern events, gave my first talk to
					aspiring Girls Who Code, met interns from all over the world, and made memories that I'll remember forever.

					<br></br>

					I also wrote a Medium article about my experience at Workday <a href="https://medium.com/@maitri.shah101/my-internship-at-workday-c5ba65871ccf" style="color: #EABFB9; text-decoration: underline"> here </a> if you're interested in learning more about my
					experience!
